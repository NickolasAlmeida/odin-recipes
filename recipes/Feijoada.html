    <p>My version of this national Brazilian black bean stew uses a variety of smoked meats and is topped with an orange
        <br> breadcrumb mixture. Serve with white rice and greens to complete this traditional meal.

    <ul><h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <li>1 pound dry black beans</li>
        <li>2 quarts water, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>3 ounces dried beef, chopped</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 smoked pork chops, cut into large chunks, bones reserved</li>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) links Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley</li>
        
    </ul>
    <ul><h4>For the crumbs:</h4>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h4>Directions:</h4>
        <li><p>Place black beans into a large bowl, cover with water, and soak overnight. Drain beans.</p></li>
        <li><p>drained beans in heavy pot with 2 quarts of water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.
               <br> Reduce heat to low and simmer until beans are cooked but very firm, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir chopped dried beef into pot with beans. 
               <br>Add bay leaf and pork chop bones, stir and simmer on low heat for another 2 hours.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook bacon in large dry skillet over medium heat until not quite crisp. Add linguica and Italian sausage links;
                <br>cook, stirring often, until meats are brown, about 10 minutes. Remove browned meat, 
                <br>reserving accumulated fat in skillet. Slice Italian sausage into chunks.</p></li>
        <li><p>Brown onion and garlic in reserved drippings in the skillet over medium heat until onion is translucent and soft, 
            <br>stirring to deglaze the pan, about 5 minutes. Season with cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper,
            <br> salt, and black pepper; add 1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley. Cook and stir until parsley has wilted,
            <br> about 2 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir onion-spice mixture into pot with beans. Add cooked bacon, linguica sausage, Italian sausage, and pork chop chunks.
            <br>Pour in enough water so meats are just covered with liquid. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer.
            <br>Reduce heat to medium-low and cook uncovered until beans are very soft and liquid begins to thicken, about 1 hour, 
            <br>stirring occasionally. If beans begin to look dry, add more water.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Heat olive oil in a skillet. Add bread crumbs and cook and stir until crumbs are toasted. 
            <br>Stir in 2 tablespoons Italian parsley and grated orange zest.</p></li>
        <li>When beans are cooked, ladle stew into bowls and top with the toasted crumb mixture.</li>
    </ol>

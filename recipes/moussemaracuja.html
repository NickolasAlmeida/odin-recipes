      </p>
      <p>This is Brazilian favorite (and an old family recipe), and takes no cooking at all. <br>
        It's a little tart and tangy for those of you who don't like your desserts to be too sweet.

          <ul><h4>Ingredients:</h4>
              <li>8 passion fruits</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
              <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
              <li>2 cups cream</li>
          </ul>
          <ol><h4>Instructions:</h4>
              <li><p>Break passion fruits in half, and empty contents into a bowl. Use a little water to help rinse the juice out of the skins.
                  <br>Mix with hands to soften pulp. Strain through a sieve or cheesecloth. Stir in sugar and sweetened condensed milk.</p></li>
              <li><p>In a chilled bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the cream into the passion fruit mixture,
                  <br>then quickly fold in remaining cream until no streaks remain. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</p></li>  
          </ol>
